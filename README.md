An intelligent multi-agent system designed to streamline doctor appointment scheduling using LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Streamlit. The system leverages multiple collaborating agents (planner, retriever, slot manager, etc.) to handle user queries, fetch relevant data, and automate the booking processâ€”reducing manual effort and enhancing user experience.
 Features

Multi-Agent Architecture â€“ Specialized agents for query handling, slot management, and information retrieval.
